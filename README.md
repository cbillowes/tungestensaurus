# Tungstensaurus

A quest to fill the gap to becoming a full-stack senior software engineer.

## Introduction

It is entirely okay to have many years of experience and still not consider yourself a senior in the field.
The title of "senior" often goes beyond just the number of years worked and encompasses a broader set of skills, leadership qualities, and a depth of experience in handling complex challenges.

It's commendable to acknowledge your current level and focus on continuous learning and skill development, as humility and a growth mindset are valued traits in the professional world.
Being self-aware and open to growth opportunities can contribute positively to your career trajectory.

## Disclaimer

I've built this website with the help of Chat GPT so some concepts could be a bit off or just plain wrong based on my misunderstandings.
The idea is for Tungstensaurus (a Docusaurus web application) to become a community driven website where we can all learn from each other
while embarking on this transformative journey with me as I set out on a quest to become a senior software engineer or at least polish up our skills.
