          What a strange name you may say. Well, Tungsten is a chemical element
          with the symbol "W" and atomic number 74. It is a dense, hard, and
          steel-gray metal known for its high melting point.

        Tungsten is commonly used in the production of various alloys, including
        those used in the manufacture of lightbulb filaments, electrical

        used as my inspiration for the name of this project.

                Seniority is earned through experience and knowledge, not
                self-designated. It involves continuous growth, learning,
                mentoring others, making decisions, and taking responsibility,
                transcending repetitive experience.

                practice and a substantial time investment. While there are no
