1. Delve into topics you genuinely comprehend.
2. Prioritize understanding before committing information to memory.
3. Begin with foundational concepts before tackling complexities.
4. Keep questions straightforward for better understanding.
5. Use visuals to enhance memory retention.
6. Explore mnemonic techniques, like peg lists.
7. Employ cloze deletion techniques for lists, sets, and enumerations (check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ktH-TceHx8)).
8. Personalize your learning with relevant examples.
9. Leverage the speed and power of cloze deletion.
10. Approach similar topics from different angles to reinforce learning.
11. Build comprehension during the learning process, creating cloze deletions for poorly understood phrases.
12. Simultaneously learn and memorize (watch this [video](https://youtu.be/XRuLV2_A3Ts)).
13. Deal with complex items initially, simplifying incrementally based on priority and time.
14. Use multiple cloze deletions for different formulations instead of mnemonic techniques (see [Knowledge Darwinism](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_darwinism)).
15. Effectively tackle lists, sets, and enumerations with cloze deletion (explained in this [video](https://youtu.be/AmpdWZEAX3Q)).
16. Personalize learning by adding your own stories to studied texts. Be creatively elaborate.
17. Enhance understanding with external references.
18. If enjoyment decreases, revisit these rules to identify possible violations impacting engagement.
19. Strive for maximum applicability of acquired knowledge.
20. Aim for the formulation of atomic memories set within a context of simplicity and comprehension.

### Peg Lists

A peg list is a mnemonic technique that involves creating a set of pegs or anchors, each associated with a specific number or order.
These pegs serve as memory aids to help recall information in a particular sequence.
The idea is to link the items you want to remember with the pegs, making it easier to retrieve them later.

For example, if you have a list of items to remember in a specific order, you can create a peg list using numbers as pegs.
Each number represents a vivid image or concept that you associate with the item you want to remember.
When you recall the pegs, it triggers the memory of the associated items in the desired sequence.

Peg lists are particularly useful for remembering ordered information, such as a series of steps, items on a list, or key points in a presentation.
The more creative and memorable the associations you create between the pegs and the information, the more effective this mnemonic technique becomes.

#### Cloze Deletion

Cloze deletion is a technique used in learning and memorization, particularly in the context of spaced repetition and flashcard-based learning systems.
It involves slashing specific elements (words, phrases, or segments) from a piece of information, leaving gaps that you must fill in.

**Original Text:**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The capital of France is Paris."\
**Cloze Deletion:** "The capital of France is **\_**."

The learner would then try to recall the missing word or phrase, reinforcing their memory and understanding of the concept.
This technique is effective in promoting active recall and engagement, making it a popular method in educational settings and with tools like Anki or SuperMemo for creating personalized flashcards.

In the context of the 20 rules you provided, cloze deletion is recommended for handling lists, sets, enumerations, and for simplifying complex information during the learning process.
It allows learners to focus on specific elements, test their understanding, and reinforce memory in a targeted manner.
