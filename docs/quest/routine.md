# Routine

Improve your technical proficiency & problem solving skills by staying consistent and motivated.
Set up a routine that works for you and stick to it.
Here is an example of what you can do:

## Daily

- Write code! Commit something useful to GitHub to build a reputation and prove dedication and commitment on your timeline.
- Dedicate time to stay informed about industry trends and emerging technologies.
- Explore a concept or topic of interest by reading a blog post, watching a video, listening to a podcast, reading a book, or simply reading the documentation.
- Complete a few minutes of flashcards of topics of interest.
- Write down something you have learned. Micro-blog it or save it for an actual blog post.
- Track your progress. Keep a journal or log of your daily activities and accomplishments.

## Weekly

- Set clear, specific, achievable, and measurable goals for the week. Write them down and track your progress.
- Solve a coding challenge to reinforce your skills.
- Start mastering common algorithms like sorting, searching and that of dynamic programming. Apply algorithms to online platform quizzes or puzzles, personal projects or contribute to open-source projects.
- Reflect by evaluating your progress and set goals for the following week.

## Monthly

- Identify your strengths and weaknesses in programming languages, data structures, and algorithms by completing one or more assessments. Refresh your core concepts, use online platforms (e.g., HackerRank, LeetCode) for self-assessment.
- Practice explaining your thought process in mock technical interviews.
- Create a blog post, audio file or video (or whatever) to share your learnings with the community.
- Analyze and document the system design of a well-known application or write a clone of a popular application.
