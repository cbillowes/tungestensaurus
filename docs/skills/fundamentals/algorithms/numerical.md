# Numerical

Numerical algorithms involve computational procedures for solving mathematical problems with numerical values.
They encompass methods for performing arithmetic operations, solving equations, approximating functions, and analyzing numerical data.

Numerical algorithms are essential in scientific, engineering, and computational applications where obtaining precise analytical solutions is challenging or impractical.

Examples:
- **Root-finding** methods (e.g., Newton's method), linear algebra algorithms (e.g., matrix multiplication), and optimization algorithms
- **Euclidean Algorithm for GCD:** Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** Generate prime numbers efficiently.
