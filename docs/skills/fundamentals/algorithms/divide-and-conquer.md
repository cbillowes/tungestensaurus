# Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

First, the problem is divided into simpler instances. Each sub-problem is then solved independently, often recursively applying the same divide-and-conquer approach.
The solutions to the sub-problems are combined to obtain the overall solution to the original problem.

An analogy would be organizing a large group of people into smaller teams to efficiently tackle various tasks, with each team working independently before combining their results to achieve a common goal. This strategy is commonly employed in algorithms like merge sort and binary search.

### Strassen's Matrix Multiplication

Strassen's algorithm is an algorithm used for matrix multiplication. It was developed by Volker Strassen in 1969 and is known for its efficiency in certain cases compared to the standard matrix multiplication algorithm, especially for large matrices.

The standard matrix multiplication algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the size of the matrices. Strassen's algorithm, on the other hand, reduces the number of multiplications required from 8 to 7 by using a clever recursive approach. The time complexity of Strassen's algorithm is approximately O(n^log2(7)), which leads to a faster multiplication for sufficiently large matrices.

Imagine you have two special boards with a bunch of numbers on them, and you want to find out what happens when you multiply these numbers together. But instead of just looking at each number one by one, there's a clever way called Strassen's Magic!

With Strassen's Magic, you can break down the big multiplication into smaller, easier problems. It's like if you had a big bag of candy, and you shared it with friends, but you did it in a way that's quicker than counting each candy one by one. Strassen's Magic helps you figure out the result of multiplying those numbers on the boards in a smarter and quicker way, making it a special trick for big number problems!
