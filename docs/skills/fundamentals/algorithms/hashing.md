# Hashing

The concept of mapping data to fixed-size arrays using a hash function, where similar inputs produce unique hash codes.

Collision resolution strategies are then employed to handle instances where different inputs yield the same hash code, preventing conflicts.

Exploring various collision resolution techniques, such as chaining or open addressing, helps comprehend how to manage and organize data efficiently within hash tables while minimizing collisions.
