# Tree

Tree algorithms involve computational techniques for solving problems related to tree structures, which consist of nodes connected by edges in a hierarchical arrangement.

Analogously, these algorithms can be likened to navigation systems efficiently determining optimal routes through a branching network, optimizing decisions based on the hierarchical relationships between different paths.

Just as navigation algorithms guide users through a tree-like road network, tree algorithms navigate and manipulate hierarchical structures in computational problems, addressing tasks like traversal, searching, and optimization within tree data structures.

Examples:

1. **Tree Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order):** Understand how to traverse binary trees.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations:** Insertion, deletion, searching in a binary search tree.
