## Explanations

To understand and define the requirements in system design, follow these key steps:

### Gather Stakeholder Requirements

Communicate with stakeholders, including clients, users, and other relevant parties, to gather their expectations, needs, and constraints.
This could involve interviews, surveys, or workshops to capture a comprehensive understanding.

### Define Functional Requirements

Clearly articulate the system's functionalities and features.
Break down these functionalities into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) requirements.
This helps in creating a detailed roadmap for the development process.

Functional requirements are typically defined in a document known as the "Functional Requirements Specification" or "Functional Specification."
This document outlines the specific functionalities, features, and capabilities that the system or software application must possess to meet the needs of its users and stakeholders.
Here are common places where functional requirements are defined:

1. **Functional Requirements Specification (FRS):**\
   The primary document for defining functional requirements is the Functional Requirements Specification (FRS). This comprehensive document describes each functional aspect of the system, including input and output behavior, user interactions, and system responses.

2. **User Stories:**\
   In Agile development methodologies, functional requirements are often expressed as user stories. Each user story represents a specific functionality from the user's perspective and includes acceptance criteria that define the conditions for the functionality to be considered complete.

3. **Use Cases:**\
   Use cases describe interactions between users and the system. They outline specific scenarios or situations where the system must respond to user actions. Use cases are often used to capture functional requirements in a narrative format.

4. **Flowcharts and Diagrams:**\
   Visual representations, such as flowcharts, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams, can be used to define functional requirements. These diagrams help illustrate how different components of the system interact and what functionalities they support.

5. **Prototypes and Mockups:**\
   Creating prototypes or mockups can be an effective way to define functional requirements, especially in user interface design. Prototypes provide a tangible representation of how users will interact with the system and what features it will include.

6. **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):**\
   A Requirements Traceability Matrix helps link each functional requirement back to its source, ensuring that every requirement is accounted for and aligns with the project's objectives. It serves as a valuable tool for managing and tracking requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

7. **Collaborative Workshops and Meetings:**\
   Functional requirements can also be defined through collaborative workshops and meetings with stakeholders, including product owners, business analysts, and end-users. These sessions allow for real-time discussions and feedback on specific functionalities.

8. **Database Design:**\
   For systems involving data storage, the definition of functional requirements may extend to the design of the database. This includes specifying the data entities, relationships, and the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations associated with them.

9. **System Use and Test Cases:**\
   Use cases and test cases are closely related, as both describe the expected behavior of the system. By defining system use cases, you inherently define the functional requirements that need to be tested to ensure the system's correctness.

10. **Functional Requirements Document (FRD):**\
    Depending on the organization's terminology, functional requirements may be documented in a Functional Requirements Document (FRD) instead of an FRS. The goal is to have a well-documented reference that guides the development team throughout the project.

This specific format and tools used for defining functional requirements may vary based on the project's methodology, industry standards, and organizational preferences.
It's essential to choose a format that aligns with the project's & company's needs and facilitates effective communication among team members.
