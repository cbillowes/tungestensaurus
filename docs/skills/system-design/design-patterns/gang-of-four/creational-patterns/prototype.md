# Prototype

The Prototype Pattern is like making photocopies of something, where you create a copy of an existing object to save time and effort.
It allows you to create new objects by duplicating existing ones, avoiding the need to start from scratch each time.
It's like using a template to quickly make many identical items.

## Definition

Enables the creation of objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
It involves creating new objects by duplicating the state of an existing object, providing a convenient way to
produce multiple instances with similar characteristics.

## Considerations

Ensure that the prototype object is in a consistent state, and be cautious about sharing mutable objects
between instances to prevent unintended side effects.

## Benefits

Facilitates the creation of new objects without specifying their exact classes, simplifying the process of generating copies.
Efficiently handles the creation of similar objects, reducing the need for repetitive initialization code.

## Tradeoffs

Requires careful management of object state to prevent unintended side effects.
Depending on the programming language or framework, cloning mechanisms might not always be straightforward or efficient.

## Practical Use Case

**Object Cloning:**\
In scenarios where creating an object is resource-intensive, such as database connections or large configuration setups, the Prototype Pattern can be employed for object cloning. Instead of creating new instances from scratch, existing objects are cloned to save time and resources.

## Code Example

```python
import copy

class Prototype:
    def clone(self):
        pass

class ConcretePrototype(Prototype):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def clone(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)

# Example usage
original_object = ConcretePrototype("Initial data")
copied_object = original_object.clone()

print(f"Original object data: {original_object.data}")
print(f"Copied object data: {copied_object.data}")
```

In this example, `ConcretePrototype` is a prototype class with a `clone` method that creates a deep copy of the object. You can then use this prototype to efficiently create new instances with the same initial data.
