# Introduction

The Gang of Four (GoF) refers to a group of four software engineers who authored the influential book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software."

Published in 1994, the book is a seminal work in the field of software engineering and design patterns. The Gang of Four consists of Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

In their book, they systematically cataloged and described 23 design patterns that have since become fundamental concepts in object-oriented software design, providing a common language and set of solutions for recurring design problems.
The Gang of Four's contributions have significantly influenced the development of software engineering principles and best practices.

## Design Patterns

The Gang of Four design patterns can be categorized into three main groups: creational, structural, and behavioral. Here are the names of the 23 patterns in their respective categories:

### Creational Patterns

1. Abstract Factory
2. Builder
3. Prototype
4. Singleton
5. Factory Method

### Structural Patterns

6. Adapter
7. Bridge
8. Composite
9. Decorator
10. Facade
11. Flyweight
12. Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

13. Chain of Responsibility
14. Command
15. Interpreter
16. Iterator
17. Mediator
18. Memento
19. Observer
20. State
21. Strategy
22. Template Method
23. Visitor
