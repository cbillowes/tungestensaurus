# Interpreter Pattern

The Interpreter Pattern is like having a language translator that helps you understand a language you're not familiar with. It allows you to define a grammar for interpreting expressions and provides a way to evaluate these expressions. It's a way of building a language interpreter for specific tasks, making it easier to work with complex rules or conditions.

## Definition

The Interpreter Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a grammar for interpreting language expressions and provides an interpreter to evaluate these expressions. It involves representing grammar rules as classes, where each class interprets a specific part of the language. Clients create an abstract syntax tree using these interpreters to interpret expressions and achieve certain behaviors.

## Considerations

Considerations for the Interpreter Pattern include designing clear and modular grammar rules, ensuring that the interpreters effectively interpret expressions, and managing the complexity introduced by multiple interpreters. It's crucial to balance the granularity of the interpreter classes to maintain a flexible and extensible system. Developers need to carefully define the language being interpreted and consider how changes to the language's grammar will impact the interpreters.

## Benefits

The Interpreter Pattern allows the definition of custom languages for specific tasks, making it suitable for domain-specific languages. It simplifies complex rule evaluation by representing them as interpreters, promoting ease of understanding. This pattern supports the addition of new language constructs without modifying existing code, enhancing the extensibility of the system.

## Trade-offs

While the Interpreter Pattern provides flexibility for defining languages, it may introduce a large number of interpreter classes, potentially leading to increased complexity. The design of interpreters needs to be well-thought-out to avoid creating an intricate hierarchy. Developers should carefully balance the benefits of language flexibility with the potential drawbacks of managing a diverse set of interpreters.

## Practical Use-Case

**SQL Query Parsing:**\
In database systems, the Interpreter Pattern can be applied to parse and evaluate SQL queries. Each component of the query, such as SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses, can be represented by individual interpreters. Combining these interpreters allows the system to evaluate and execute complex SQL queries.

## Code Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Expression: Expression
class Expression(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def interpret(self, context):
        pass

# Terminal Expression: Number
class Number(Expression):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def interpret(self, context):
        return self.value

# Non-terminal Expression: Add
class Add(Expression):
    def __init__(self, left, right):
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def interpret(self, context):
        return self.left.interpret(context) + self.right.interpret(context)

# Context
class Context:
    def __init__(self):
        self.variables = {}

# Client Code
context = Context()
context.variables['x'] = Number(5)
context.variables['y'] = Number(10)

expression = Add(Number(2), Number(3))
result = expression.interpret(context)
print(result)  # Output: 5 (2 + 3)
```

In this example, the Interpreter Pattern is demonstrated with `Expression` as the abstract expression, `Number` as a terminal expression, and `Add` as a non-terminal expression. The client code creates a context with variable values, and an expression (Addition) is interpreted within that context to produce a result.
