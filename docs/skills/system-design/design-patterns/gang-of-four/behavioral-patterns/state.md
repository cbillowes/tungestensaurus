# State Pattern

The State Pattern is like a traffic light changing colors based on the current situation â€“ it allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. Instead of having a single, monolithic class with a lot of if-else statements, the state pattern lets an object represent its various states as separate classes, making it easier to manage and extend. It's like having different modes for your device, where it behaves differently depending on its current state.

## Definition

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It defines a family of classes, each representing a different state, and allows the object to transition between states. The pattern promotes encapsulation by associating each state with a separate class, making it easier to add new states without modifying existing code. The context (object with a state) maintains a reference to the current state, delegating behavior to the state classes.

## Considerations

Considerations for the State Pattern include designing clear interfaces for state classes to ensure consistency and ease of integration. It's crucial to manage state transitions effectively, avoiding unintended behaviors when moving between states. Developers need to strike a balance between the number of state classes and the complexity of the context to avoid unnecessary class proliferation. State classes should be designed to be independent and reusable, promoting maintainability.

## Benefits

The State Pattern simplifies complex conditional logic by encapsulating behavior within state classes. It allows the addition of new states without modifying existing code, promoting extensibility. This pattern makes it easier to understand and maintain code by organizing related behaviors into separate classes. The context class becomes more focused on its primary responsibilities, leading to a cleaner and more modular design.

## Trade-offs

While the State Pattern provides flexibility in handling different states, it may introduce a larger number of classes, potentially increasing the initial complexity of the codebase. Developers need to carefully design state transitions to avoid unexpected behaviors. Overusing the State Pattern for simpler scenarios may result in unnecessary class hierarchy and abstraction. Striking a balance between encapsulation and simplicity is crucial.

## Practical Use-Case

**Document Editing Software:**\
In a document editing software, the State Pattern can be applied to represent different editing modes (states), such as Insert Mode, Selection Mode, and Formatting Mode. The context (document editor) transitions between these states, and each state class defines the specific behavior related to that mode. This allows for easy addition of new editing modes without modifying the core editor code.

## Code Example

```python
# State: State
class State:
    def handle(self):
        pass

# Concrete State: ConcreteStateA
class ConcreteStateA(State):
    def handle(self):
        return "State A"

# Concrete State: ConcreteStateB
class ConcreteStateB(State):
    def handle(self):
        return "State B"

# Context: Context
class Context:
    def __init__(self, state):
        self._state = state

    def set_state(self, state):
        self._state = state

    def request(self):
        return self._state.handle()

# Client Code
initial_state = ConcreteStateA()
context = Context(initial_state)

print(context.request())  # Output: State A

new_state = ConcreteStateB()
context.set_state(new_state)

print(context.request())  # Output: State B
```

In this example, the State Pattern is demonstrated with `State` as the state, `ConcreteStateA` and `ConcreteStateB` as concrete states, and `Context` as the context. The client code creates a context with an initial state, requests the current state's behavior, then changes the state and requests the behavior again. The behavior of the context varies based on its current state, showcasing the flexibility of the State Pattern.
