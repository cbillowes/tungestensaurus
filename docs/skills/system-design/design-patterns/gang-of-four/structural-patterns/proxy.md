# Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern is like having a personal assistant who manages certain tasks for you. Instead of directly interacting with a resource, you delegate the interactions to the proxy, which can control access, perform additional actions, or act as a stand-in for the real thing. It's a way to add an extra layer of control or functionality to the interactions with an object or service.

## Definition

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that represents another object, acting as a surrogate or placeholder. It controls access to the real object, allowing for additional actions, such as logging, security checks, or lazy loading. The pattern involves creating a proxy class that mimics the interface of the real object, intercepting and managing the requests. Proxies can enhance the behavior of the real object without the client knowing the difference.

## Considerations

Considerations for the Proxy Pattern include designing clear interfaces for both the real object and the proxy. It's important to carefully manage the additional responsibilities assigned to the proxy to avoid overburdening it. Proper error handling and communication between the proxy and the real object should be implemented to ensure a seamless experience for clients.

## Benefits

The Proxy Pattern provides a way to control access to the real object, adding security checks or logging as needed. It allows for the implementation of lazy loading, where the real object is created only when required, improving performance. Proxies can act as intermediaries, managing resource-intensive tasks or providing additional functionalities without altering the real object.

## Trade-offs

While the Proxy Pattern enhances control and functionality, it may introduce complexity by adding an extra layer between the client and the real object. Developers need to carefully design proxies to avoid becoming a bottleneck in system performance. Balancing the benefits of added features with potential drawbacks is crucial for maintaining an efficient and maintainable system.

## Practical Use Case

**Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):**\
In a VPN system, proxy servers act as intermediaries between users and the internet. They can control access, provide security checks, and cache resources, enhancing the overall network experience for users.

## Code Example

```python
# Subject: Image
class Image:
    def display(self):
        pass

# Real Subject: RealImage
class RealImage(Image):
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.load_image()

    def load_image(self):
        print(f"Loading image from file: {self.filename}")

    def display(self):
        print(f"Displaying image: {self.filename}")

# Proxy: ImageProxy
class ImageProxy(Image):
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.real_image = None

    def display(self):
        if self.real_image is None:
            self.real_image = RealImage(self.filename)
        self.real_image.display()

# Client Code
image_proxy = ImageProxy("nature.jpg")
image_proxy.display()  # This triggers the creation and display of the RealImage
image_proxy.display()  # This reuses the already loaded RealImage
```

In this example, the Proxy Pattern is illustrated with an `ImageProxy` that controls access to the real object, `RealImage`. The proxy ensures that the real image is loaded only when needed, providing additional control and functionality while maintaining a consistent interface for clients.
