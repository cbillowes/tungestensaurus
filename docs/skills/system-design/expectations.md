# Expectations

As a senior software engineer, your understanding of designing systems should cover various aspects. Here are key expectations, each accompanied by a simple explanation and real-world examples:

### Architectural Patterns

Grasp common architectural patterns that guide the organization and structure of software systems.
Microservices Architecture - Breaking down a monolithic application into small, independent services, e.g., Netflix.

### Scalability and Performance

Understand techniques for optimizing performance and scaling systems to handle increased load.
Horizontal Scaling - Adding more server instances to distribute load, e.g., Google's use of multiple servers to handle search queries.

### Reliability and Fault Tolerance

Ensure systems operate consistently and can recover gracefully from failures.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Uses redundancy, automated failover, and distributed systems for high reliability.

### Security Considerations

Recognize security implications and implement measures to protect against vulnerabilities.
HTTPS - Employing secure communication protocols to safeguard data during transmission, e.g., online banking systems.

### Microservices and Decentralized Architectures

Understand the benefits and challenges of breaking down systems into independent, manageable services.
Airbnb - Uses microservices to independently develop and deploy different features of its platform.

### Containerization and Orchestration

Grasp container technologies (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for efficient deployment and scaling.
Spotify - Utilizes Docker containers and Kubernetes for scalable and efficient deployment of its music streaming services.

### Database Design and Scaling

Comprehend database design principles and scaling strategies to handle data efficiently.
Facebook - Implements sharding to horizontally scale its massive user data storage.

### RESTful API Design

Design APIs following REST principles for simplicity, scalability, and interoperability.
Twitter - Offers a RESTful API for developers to interact with its platform programmatically.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Understand systems where components communicate via events, enabling loose coupling and scalability.
Uber - Uses event-driven architecture for real-time updates and communication between components.

### DevOps Practices

Embrace collaboration between development and operations teams, emphasizing automation and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).
Etsy - Implements DevOps practices to enable frequent, reliable software releases.

### Monitoring and Logging

Recognize the importance of monitoring and logging for system health, performance, and issue diagnosis.
New Relic - Provides monitoring and analytics solutions for tracking application performance.

### Continuous Learning and Improvement

Foster a culture of continuous improvement, staying abreast of new technologies and best practices.
Google - Encourages engineers to spend 20% of their time on personal projects, fostering innovation and learning.

These understandings collectively contribute to a senior software engineer's ability to design systems that are scalable, reliable, secure, and maintainable, aligning with the needs and goals of the organization.
