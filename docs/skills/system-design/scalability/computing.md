# Computing

## Elastic computing

Utilizes cloud services to automatically scale computing resources up or down based on workload, optimizing performance and cost efficiency.

## Serverless computing

Enables developers to build and run applications without managing server infrastructure, automatically scaling based on demand.

## Hybrid cloud

Combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources, providing flexibility and scalability based on specific workload demands.

## Industry solutions

Given an event-driven architected application with serverless computing, what acceptable cloud solutions can be used to build the application to scale automatically based on demand?
AWS Lambda, Azure Functions.

Given a solution that needs to be deployed across multiple cloud providers for increased resilience, flexibility and scalability, what solutions could you implement?
Google Anthos, Red Hat OpenShift

Given an IoT platform with Edge Computing that distributes computing resources closer to IoT devices, allowing for scalable and efficient processing of data at the edge, what industry solutions could you implement this with?
Microsoft Azure IoT Edge, AWS IoT Greengrass
